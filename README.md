### Linear Clasiifiers

#### Perceptron 
The perceptron algorithm is the building block of deep learning. It updates on one data point at each time and moves in the right direction based on that point. <br>
Mathematically, the perceptron update is
>$\bar{\theta}^{(k+1)}=\bar{\theta}^{k}+y_i\bar{x}_i$
