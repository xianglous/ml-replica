# Linear Clasiifiers
Linear classifiers classifies the input features based on the decision hyperplane in the feature space.

## Perceptron
The perceptron algorithm is the building block of deep learning. It updates on one data point at each time and moves in the "right" direction based on that point. <br><br>
*Pseudocode* (w/o offset)
<pre>
k=0, w=0
<b>while</b> not all correctly classified <b>and</b> k < max step:
    <b>for</b> i in 1...n:
        <b>if</b> yi(w.Xi) <= 0: // misclassified
            w = w + yiXi // the Update
            k++
</pre>
*Pseudocode* (w/ offset)
<pre>
k=0, w=0, b=0
<b>while</b> not all correctly classified <b>and</b> k < max step:
    <b>for</b> i in 1...n:
        <b>if</b> yi(w.Xi+b) <= 0: // misclassified
            w = w + yiXi // the Update
            b = b + yi // offset update
            k++
</pre>
*Note*: we can convert the w/ offset version to w/o by transforming `X` to `[1, X]`, then the first resulting weight parameter would be the offset.

## Stochastic Gradient Descent
Perceptron is nice and simple, but it has an important restriction: it only converges on linearly-separable data. <br>
To make it work for non-separable data, we need to change the way it approaches the best model. 

### Loss Functions
In machine learning, we often use a loss function to measure the fit of the current model to the training data. For example, the perceptron algorithm uses the following loss function:
