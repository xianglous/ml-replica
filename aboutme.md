My name is **Xianglong Li** (<span style="font-family:Siyuansongti">李翔龙</span>), I am a **Master of Science in Computer Science** student at Yale University. I got my **Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science** and **Data Science** at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (<span style="color:#FFCB05;font-weight:bold">Go</span> <span style="color:#00274C;font-weight:bold">Blue!</span>). 

I am enthusiastic about machine learning and natural language processing. In summer 2022, I interned at <a href="https://www.initium.ai/"><b>Initium.AI</b></a> as a **Machine Learning Software Engineer** during which I developed efficient pipelines for information extraction and generation from conversational data. You can learn more about my work on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/xianglong-li-560628157/"><b>LinkedIn</b></a> page.

Currently, I am applying for **Software Development Engineer** positions for new graduates in 2023.
